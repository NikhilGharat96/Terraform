Before applying main.tf file you have to made some changes. </br>
                        </br>
--> In terraform.tfvars file enter your access and secret keys.</br>
--> And if your instance is not creats so that replace ami_id with new one. 
     i.e. copy from ami catlog and replace with this. </br>
--> ami-id are region specified so you have to take correct ami-id .
    if you have to launch instance in us-east-1 and you take the ami-id from another region so it not works.
